In this benchmark analysis, firstly we have checked as most as we could the capabilities and characteristics of the processors of the computers in the department of computer science in University of Cyprus Labs. After these we have taken the benchmark 508.namd_r from SPEC CPU2017 ,we have studied the use, its inputs and  outputs of this benchmark program, we have tested the performance of the specific type of computers in the labs on this benchmark program (we checked the performance on a program that is strongly associated with big processing of floating point numbers ) with command perf stat, we estimated the time that the program need to run and we have analyzed all these data by creating tables and graphs that show how the performance and the time of a program like this can be affected by the hardware and more important ,what are the reasons and factors that affect it and why these factors appear.
